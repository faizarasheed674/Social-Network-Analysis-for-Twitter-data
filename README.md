The main goal of this research is to figure out information pertaining to the T20 world cup
semi-final match between Pakistan and Australia using Twitter data. During events such as the
T-2o World Cup, twitter communication networks play a critical role. Annotation, Hashtags,
Mentions, Retweets, URLs, and replies to twitter data were used to create several graphs. The
number of tweets in the data was used to determine the relevance of user activity. Different
social network analysis techniques, such as centrality, modularity, degree, and other related
measures, are used to analyse the graphs. We observe that, during the semifinal match, network
entities communicated very frequently about match and shared information with each other.
The flow of information is also detected as retweet and replied to network clearly state the
direction of flow of information from a strong entity.
